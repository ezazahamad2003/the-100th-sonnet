The guide.
From 16th November 2024, it took 90 - 27 days to complete the 100th sonnet.
Every piece of my original work – with infinite unexpressed emotions, hidden in my simple words – is now written down.
Each sonnet is written with a deeper meaning and feel; if you don't understand at first, give it some time and reread those magical words.
Magical, I may say – but it is not a grimoire nor a book of spells,
yet each word is encoded with true love and adoration for the person.
Here is my final work to convey everything and give my 100% to win the 1% chance of being with you.
